\begin{document}

This document is an \emph{example/notes} for learning \LaTeX (using \href{https://www.tug.org/twg/mactex/tutorials/ltxprimer-1.0.pdf}{this book} ).
Continuing the text on this line (rather than above) makes no difference for the paragraph.

The blank line above forces a new paragraph to start here.
Having multiple         spaces between words doesn't make a difference (it's treated as one space).
This symbol \ forces an extra space to be added!

testing other languages: aquí, γεια σας (this doesn't work directly, at least without some greek font).


\noindent This paragraph will start without an indent!
% insert content from another file:
\input{otherfile.tex}

\begin{center}
  Spacing:

\end{flushright}

  This is aligned to the left.
