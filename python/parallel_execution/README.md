# Python multiprocessing / multithreading practice

TODO:
* experiment with joblib
* learn [multiprocessing.queue](https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Queue)

## Asyncio
> Doesn't use multithreading or multiprocessing, but rather efficiently jumps around execution in the (single) thread e.g when execution is IO bound (being sure to use the `await` keyword in those cases).
